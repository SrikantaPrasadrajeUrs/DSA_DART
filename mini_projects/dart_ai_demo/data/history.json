Write Tests Before (or While) Writing Code\n\n**(Tip: Embrace Test-Driven Development Principles)**\n\n*   **Why it matters:** Good code is verifiable code. Testing forces you to think about the functionality and the edge cases *before* you're emotionally invested in your implementation.\n*   **Actionable Advice:**\n    *   **Start with the expected output:** If you are writing a function that sorts a list, write the test case showing the input list and the exact sorted output list first.\n    *   **Use a testing framework:** Don't just `print()` things to check; use built-in frameworks (like JUnit for Java, Pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript) to automate verification and ensure future changes don't break old functionality (regression).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Prioritize Clarity Over Conciseness (Always)\n\n**(Tip: Code is read far more often than it is written)**\n\n*   **Why it matters:** You, or a teammate, will inevitably return to this code months later. Confusingly short or hyper-optimized code takes far longer to debug and understand than slightly longer, well-named code.\n*   **Actionable Advice:**\n    *   **Use Descriptive Naming:** Name variables, functions, and classes based on *what they do* or *what they represent*, not just on type.\n        *   ❌ Bad: `def proc_data(a1, b2)`\n        *   ✅ Good: `def process_user_transactions(pending_items, user_id)`\n    *   **Don't skip comments for \"Why\":** If you implement a fix or a feature in a non-obvious way (e.g., using a specific mathematical optimization, or working around a library bug), add a comment explaining *why* you chose that particular solution.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Break Down Problems Into the Smallest Possible Units\n\n**(Tip: Master Modularity and Separation of Concerns)**\n\n*   **Why it matters:** Large, complex functions are brittle, hard to test, and difficult to maintain. By breaking down tasks into small, dedicated functions or methods, you create reusable building blocks.\n*   **Actionable Advice:**\n    *   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function or class should have only one reason to change. If your function fetches data, validates it, and saves it to a database, split it into three separate functions: `fetch_data()`, `validate_data()`, and `save_data()`.\n    *   **Reduce Function Length:** Aim for functions that fit easily on one screen (ideally 10-20 lines maximum). If a function grows too large, it’s a sign that it’s doing too many things and needs refactoring."},{"input":"eit","output":"\"EIT\" can stand for several things, depending on the context.\n\nThe most common interpretation is:\n\n1.  **EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology):** An independent body of the European Union established to strengthen Europe's capacity to innovate.\n\nIt could also be a typo for:\n\n*   **Eight** (the number)\n*   **Eat** (the verb)\n\nCould you provide more context?"},{"input":"hello","output":"Hello!
